# jarvis

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


This application utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT and Dall-E API to create a voice assistant named Jarvis. You can ask Jarvis any questions you may have, and it will respond with an appropriate answer.

To use the application, simply click the microphone button and speak your question. Jarvis will convert your speech to text and send it to the OpenAI ChatGPT API for processing. Once a response is generated, Jarvis will read it aloud to you using text-to-speech technology.

OpenAI's ChatGPT API is capable of handling a wide variety of questions, so feel free to ask anything that comes to mind. Additionally, the Dall-E API can generate images based on text input, which could be useful in future updates to this application.

Check out the video demo linked above to see Jarvis in action. In the demo, I ask "what is chemistry?" and receive a detailed response from Jarvis. (Unfortunately, the audio could not be recorded.)
